# EEG Normal Disorder classification
Classification of normal and mental disorder EEG signal based on Machine Learning algorithm.

This project includes three steps:
1. Preprocessing data
2. Training Model
3. Predict

Different types of classifiers have been trained using Classification Learner toolbox in MATLAB. You can find the **classifiers** above.
This Projec was done for **National Brain Mapping Lab**.
